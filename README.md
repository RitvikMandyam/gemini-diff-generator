# gemini-diff-generator

This is a recreation of some of the functionality of an existing AI copilot tool that shall remain unnamed. The company that makes it, whose name rhymes with "Foogle", decided to add a bunch of crappy, agentic features to it which made it very nearly unusable for me, so I built this extension to replace it, with the functionality from it that I liked.

## Features

1. Multi-file context
2. Focused diffs and easy diff viewing/application

## Requirements

You need to put your API key for Gemini in in settings. You can find the setting for it by searching in settings for "Gemini-diff-generator".

## Known Issues

This thing could be buggy, I vibe coded it in a few hours while doing other things.

## Usage
Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac), search for "Start Gemini Diff Generator". Things should be pretty self-explanatory after that.
